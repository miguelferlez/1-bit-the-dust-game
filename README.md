# 1-Bit The Dust
Unity personal project I made in 2019 (god I'm terrible at naming projects), based on classical 2D platform games. Despite the main characterists from this genre, I added a timer so the player will face different difficulties (easy, medium and hard, to be more specific) depending on at what time the current level was finished. This demo has 3 levels (each one with its 3 difficult versions). All tilesets and sprites used in this project came from:
- [Dunjo tileset](https://arks.itch.io/dungeon-platform-tileset) by [Arks](https://arks.itch.io/)
- [Oubliette tileset](https://safwyl.itch.io/oubliette-tileset) by [safwyl](https://safwyl.itch.io/)
