# 1 Bit The Dust
Unity personal project I made in 2019 (god I'm terrible at naming projects), based on classical 2D platform games. Despite the main characterists from this genre, I added a timer so the player will face different difficulties (easy, medium and hard, to be more specific) depending on at what time the current level was finished.
All tilesets and sprites used in this project came from:
- [Dunjo tileset](https://arks.itch.io/dungeon-platform-tileset) by [Arks](https://arks.itch.io/)
- [Oubliette tilset](https://safwyl.itch.io/oubliette-tileset) by [safwyl](https://safwyl.itch.io/)
